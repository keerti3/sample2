            <h2>Mackerel</h2>
            <p>Mackerel are fast-swimming, migratory fish commonly found in large schools near the ocean’s surface, making them an important species in both marine ecosystems and global fisheries. </p>
            <p>Their streamlined bodies and high oil content make them efficient swimmers and a rich source of nutrition for predators and humans alike.</p>
