            <h2>Eels</h2>
            <p>Eels are elongated, snake-like fish that inhabit both freshwater and marine environments, often hiding in crevices and ambushing prey with their sharp teeth.</p>
            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Electric eels are actually knifefish, and are not in the same order as true eels. They can generate an electric current to stun or kill prey</li>
              <li>Moray eels are predators that hunt at night, hiding in rocks during the day. They have poor vision, so they use their sense of smell to find prey. </li>
