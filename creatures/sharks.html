            <h2>Sharks: Guardians of the Ocean Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>Sharks are essential apex predators that maintain balance in marine ecosystems by regulating the populations of other species, ensuring the health of ocean habitats.</p>
            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Many have several rows of teeth and can lose and replace thousands of teeth in their lifetimes. As predators, sharks play a vital role in the health of marine ecosystems - by eating fish they help create balance in the food chain.</li>
              <li>From the smallest dwarf lantern shark (which is about the size of a human hand), to the largest which can be up to 12 metres long - the whale shark.</li>
