        <h1 class="with-underline">REEF EXPLORER 9</h1>
        <p>Reef Explorer 9 is a two-stage deep-sea exploration vessel designed for the reliable and safe transportation of marine scientists, coral reef monitoring equipment, and research payloads to the worldâ€™s most remote coral reefs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block dragon">
        <h2 class="with-underline">CORAL TRANSPORT MODULE</h2>
        <p>The Coral Transport Module is designed to carry sensitive marine life, coral samples, and monitoring tools in its pressurized chamber. The lower, unpressurized section allows for the safe transport of larger oceanographic instruments and secondary research payloads. In the future, this module will accommodate human divers for deep-sea coral reef research.

        <h2>NINE PROPULSION ENGINES</h2>
        <p>With its nine first-stage engines clustered together, the Reef Explorer 9 can sustain up to two propulsion system shutdowns during a mission and still safely complete its research journey. This key reliability feature makes it one of the most trusted vessels for coral reef exploration..</p>
