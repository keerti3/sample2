            <h2>Mars</h2>
            <p>Mars, often called the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is known for its reddish appearance, which is due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, and it has been a target for exploration by both robotic spacecraft and, eventually, human missions.</p>
